## Installation
- `pip install pygame`
- Run main.py
- If it does not work check what versions of python, pip and pygame you have installed
  - Versions I use
    - PIP: `pip-23.2.1`
    - Python: `3.9`
    - Pygame: `pygame-2.5.0`
   
Or download the zip with the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/MaximFiedler/PhilGame/releases/)
> Extract the zip file and open the main.exe file. Important! The resources folder must be in the same folder as the main.exe.

## How to play?
Use <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to jump and <kbd>LSHIFT</kbd> to glide<br>
If you collide with a logo you loose one IQ<br>
You will die if you have no IQ left

TODO
- Clean code
- Seperate hitboxes from images
- Pause screen
